## Title  
**Do Dynamic Pupillary Light Reflex Parameters Reflect and Predict Sensory Traits?**  
Multivariate and Machine Learning Evidence in Adults

---

## Description  
This dataset accompanies a study investigating whether dynamic pupillary light reflex (PLR) parameters reflect and predict sensory processing traits in adults.

It includes:
- Summary-level PLR indices extracted from pupil recordings
- Self-report questionnaire scores related to neurodevelopmental and sensory processing traits

All PLR indices were computed from raw pupil diameter data recorded at 500 Hz using a controlled light stimulation protocol. Questionnaire scores were obtained using Japanese-validated versions of standardized psychometric instruments.

**Note:**  
Each row represents a single participant. No personal identifiers are included.
